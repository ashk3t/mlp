# Multilayer perceptron
You can fit MLP Classifier model specifying following parameters:
- number of layers
- neurons per layer
- activation function
- ridge regularization strength
- batch size
- learning rate
- number of iterations
- epsilon

It fits blazingly fast because all matrix operations are numpy-vectorized for all dimensions
